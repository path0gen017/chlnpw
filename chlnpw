      -h help Display this help information
      -b Creates a backup copy of the password-containing file in the same directory as this script
      -p path=[ARGUMENT] ARGUMENT should be the path to the shadow file.Note the default path is the path to the host's shadow file
      If only a directory is given in the path,then the default filename is shadow.However you can overwrite this by giving the full path including the filename
      -l dump the usernames in the shadow file onto the screen.Include the -v options for more information such as the algorithm used,the hash e.t.c
      -v To toggle verbosity
      -w This option must be there if you want the [password] to be written to the file.Note if no salt is given then one is generated randomly

Please Note that the arguments listed above should be following one another as indicated.
Also the [username] should be valid.If you dont know the usernames present in the shadow file,I advise that you run the script with the -l option first
The algorithms currently supported are sha-256(sha256crypt) sha-512(sha512crypt) and md5
Please do not enter any other algorithm as the program will not work"
